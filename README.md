This repository contains all the scripts used to generate figures in my doctoral thesis, entitled "_**How human and murine T cells meet their fate: cross-species comparison of conventional and innate T cells**_". I completed my PhD at the [CSHL School of Biological Sciences](https://www.cshl.edu/phd-program/) in May 2024, under the supervision of Dr. Hannah V. Meyer (check out the [Meyer lab](https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/)).

For now my thesis is not publicly available, however you can check out our [paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01056-8). If you're interested in exploring the data we generated, you can use our [Shiny interface](https://xspeciestcells.cshl.edu/). It contains both :
- human T cell scRNAseq+TCRseq data (from thymus & blood);
- an integrated murine dataset of all publicly available innate thymocytes scRNAseq data (i.e. MAIT, iNKT and &gamma;&delta;T cells in thymus).

If you're interested in downloading our data for your own purposes, you can find it on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE249684).
