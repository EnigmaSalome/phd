This repository contains all the scripts used to generate figures in my doctoral thesis, entitled "_**How human and murine T cells meet their fate: cross-species comparison of conventional and innate T cells**_". I completed my PhD at the [CSHL School of Biological Sciences](https://www.cshl.edu/phd-program/) in May 2024, under the supervision of Dr. Hannah V. Meyer.

For now my thesis is not publicly available, however you can check out our preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.07.570707v1.full).
