## renv environment installation

For reproducibility, all scripts were run under a `renv` environment, that was setup with `00_renv.R` script. Anyone can copy this R environment setup with the [renv.lock](../renv.lock) file in parent directory.
Check out the vignette [introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).
